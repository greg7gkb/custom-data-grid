The challenge was to replicate the .NET DataGrid control primarily using the OnPaint method of a custom control.

This project provides example code as well as an example application that demonstrates the functionality of the custom data grid control in comparison with the original .NET DataGrid control.

Work is in progress and not all of the .NET control features have yet been implemented in the custom control.

Please contact me with any comments or questions.
